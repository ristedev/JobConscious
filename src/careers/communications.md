### Communications

In a world inter-connected by every conceivable form of media, the goal of reaching the right audience with the right message has never been more attainable. New forms of media supported by a ubiquitous wireless infrastructure and the affordable hardware used to access it have forever changed how the world communicates. The hard work of laying this foundation has been the burden of previous generations – today’s challenge is to carefully build a framework of communication customized to each application.

Communication and media science has emerged as the field of study concerned with tailoring the way we communicate to different applications:

- Journalism, electronic media, and TV & radio broadcasting  
- Intercultural and multi-linguistic communications  
- Politics and public administration  
- Performing arts, speech and rhetoric  
- Business administration, industrial relations and corporate communications  
- Marketing, advertising and public relations  

By majoring in communications, students develop a critical awareness of how effective communications contribute positively to personal interactions, business relationships and the mass dissemination of information through media outlets. Communications majors develop analytical skills and functional proficiency in comprehending, interpreting, writing, and speaking, allowing them to become critical thinkers and effective problems solvers in contemporary society.

As a field of study, communications is applied to journalism, business, public relations, marketing, news broadcasting, intercultural communications, education, public administration—and beyond.

Communications majors are best defined as students that are:

- Seeking a general liberal arts education  
- Preparing for careers in fields like journalism, business administration, public relations, broadcasting, human resources, consulting and politics  
- Preparing for graduate work in media, public policy, cultural studies, international relations, law and business administration  
- Studying communications would help professionals in any field refine their speaking, writing, and critical thinking skills, while allowing them to investigate communications theories and methodologies.  

The flexibility of a communications major allows students to focus their studies on areas most relevant to their career goals.
